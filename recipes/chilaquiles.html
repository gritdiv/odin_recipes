        <h6>Delicious, comforting green chilaquiles are easy enough to make with pre-made, store-bought ingredients like tortilla chips and a jar of salsa. But to make your chilaquiles really memorable, follow this recipe to make them from scratch.</h6>
        <p>To make green chilaquiles that are abuela-worthy, the secret is in making a homemade, brothy green salsa. You make everything from scratch, right down to the chicken broth - no tetrapak! You'll shred the chicken to top your chilaquiles with the same bird you use to make your stock. Fire up your blender because you're going to make a fresh green salsa bursting with flavor (which is easier than you think). And finally, you're going to cut up day-old corn tortillas into triangles and fry them up golden brown to make the bed for your chilaquiles.</p>
